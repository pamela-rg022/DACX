### CONTEXT: 
Non-invasive internal visualization tests such as chest x-rays allow medical personnel staff can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of heart and lung diseases. However, the reading os these diagnostic images can be complex and vary between each radiologists. Therefore, we developed an automated method for X-ray analysis would support the diagnostic process with multiple purposes such as prioritize to the most serious patients using VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection dataset.

### LIBRARIES AND PROGRAMS: 
The programs and libraries used in the algoritm were [^note]: 
-

### INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. If necessary download and import the dataset, programs and libraries used in the algoritm 
2. Run the file 'main.py' available in the repository https://github.com/Ersebreck/DACX
- 2.1. If you desire to evaluate only one image run the following command main.py –mode demo –img imagen_0.png
	- i.e.  main.py –mode demo –img imagen_0.png
- 2.2 If you desire to run the algoritm for a complete set of images use the following command main.py --mode test
	- i.e. main.py --mode test
